///Moons will be distributed through a public ICO. A small portion of
///Moons will be distributed for free for gamification purposes, rewarding a long-term investor

///Moonwhale provides gamification of crypto investments to
///reward long term thinking and provide benchmarks along the way. Holding crypto assets long
///term requires patience and endurance. Itâ€™s easy to fall into traps when there are pumps or dips.
///With gamification users can both be educated about the upsides of staying out of the game of
///quick returns and provided some of the same emotional thrills that trading gives.
