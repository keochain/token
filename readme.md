# Keochain (KEO) Token

Keochain is issuing its own token, Keochain (KEO), a digital currency that has value from having utility in the Keochain platform. KEO tokens will be distributed through a public ICO. A small portion of KEO tokens will be distributed for free for gamification purposes, rewarding a long-term investor mindset and engagement in the Keochain App.

# Token Model
To support the freemium business model, Keochain introduces a utility token called KEO, issued as a ERC20 contract on the Ethereum blockchain to enable a decentralized business model where all payments such as subscription fees and success fees have a decentralized distribution through smart contracts. The fees are subtracted from the users tokens held in the Keochain App. If the held tokens are depleted the subscription and other services are paused until the user has topped up their holdings.


# Keochain (KEO)
- 1 Billion KEO tokens are issued through an ICO.
- KEO tokens provide an exclusive access to Keochain's services and offerings both for Consumers and Businesses.
- KEO tokens are issued on the Ethereum Blockchain and made liquid through listings on yet to be determined exchanges.
- Tokens not distributed in the ICO are burned.
- KEO token is inflationary with an inflation of 1.1% per annum starting out. The inflation mechanism is implemented by adding 30000 KEO tokens to the gamification pool per day.
