# Moons (XMM) Token

Moonwhale is issuing its own token, Moons (XMM), a digital currency that has value from having utility in the Moonwhale platform. Moons will be distributed through a public ICO. A small portion of Moons will be distributed for free for gamification purposes, rewarding a long-term investor mindset and engagement in the Moonwhale App.

# Token Model
To support the freemium business model, Moonwhale introduces a utility token called Moons, issued as a ERC20 contract on the Ethereum blockchain to enable a decentralized business model where all payments such as subscription fees and success fees have a decentralized distribution through smart contracts. The fees are subtracted from the users tokens held in the Moonwhale App. If the held tokens are depleted the subscription and other services are paused until the user has topped up their holdings.


# Moonwhale Moons (XMM)
- 1 Billion XMM tokens ("Moons") are issued through an ICO.
- Moons provide an exclusive access to Moonwhale's services and offerings both for Consumers and Businesses.
- Moons are issued on the Ethereum Blockchain and made liquid through listings on yet to be determined exchanges.
- Tokens not distributed in the ICO are burned.
- Moons is inflationary with an inflation of 1.1% per annum starting out. The inflation mechanism is implemented by adding 30000 Moons to the gamification pool per day.
